    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <h3>Experiment Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Set up the crosswell measurement geometry</b> with source and receiver wells at carefully chosen depths to ensure thorough coverage of the subsurface area of interest.</li>
      <li><b>Acquire seismic travel time data</b> across multiple source-receiver pairs by activating sources at various depths and recording arrivals at the receivers.</li>
      <li><b>Construct the system matrix (A)</b> that relates travel times to model parameters, based on the geometry and an initial velocity model for the medium.</li>
      <li><b>Apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)</b> to the system matrix to obtain matrices <b>U</b>, <b>&Sigma;</b>, and <b>V<sup>T</sup></b>. This step analyzes the stability and invertibility of the problem.</li>
      <li><b>Filter small singular values</b> in <b>&Sigma;</b> to stabilize the inversion and reduce the impact of noise.</li>
      <li><b>Use the filtered SVD to reconstruct the velocity/resolution model</b> of the subsurface between the boreholes by back-solving the SVD system.</li>
      <li><b>Visualize the results</b> with heatmaps and raypath diagrams to analyze model resolution, data coverage, and geophysical features.</li>
      <li><b>Iterate</b>: Repeat the procedure with different acquisition geometries or SVD regularization thresholds to study their influence on model clarity.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>SVD inversion</b> is essential for robust seismic tomographyâ€”direct inversion is often unstable in practical scenarios.</li>
      <li><b>Heatmaps and raypath plots</b> help identify areas of high and low model resolution, indicating where results are reliable.</li>
      <li><b>Denser and more uniform raypath coverage</b> provides better resolution in the final model.</li>
      <li>Repeat the experiment with different <b>source depths</b> or <b>singular value cutoffs</b> to improve understanding and model accuracy.</li>
    </ul>

      <b>Tip:</b> Always check the resolution and coverage maps before interpreting velocity variations. Poor data coverage or inadequate filtering can mislead tomographic analysis!
