    <h2>Theory</h2>
    <p>
      Crosswell tomography uses seismic waves traveling between boreholes to image subsurface properties such as slowness or velocity variations. By measuring travel times from a source in one borehole to receivers in another, we build a system of equations Gm = d, where:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>G</strong> is the ray path matrix constructed from path lengths through discretized subsurface grid cells,</li>
      <li><strong>m</strong> represents the unknown slowness anomaly model to be estimated,</li>
      <li><strong>d</strong> contains the observed seismic travel times.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The solution of this inverse problem is often ill-posed or rank deficient, meaning that many models can fit the data equally well, and noise can destabilize direct inversion. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) decomposes G into orthogonal components with associated singular values showing their significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truncated SVD (TSVD) suppresses contributions from small singular values that amplify noise, producing a regularized minimum-length least squares solution. This process balances resolution and stability, allowing reliable imaging of subsurface features.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rank Deficiency:</strong> Indicates the number of independent constraints available; SVD helps identify this rank.</li>
      <li><strong>Model Resolution:</strong> TSVD limits model complexity to stable components, with some smoothing of true features.</li>
      <li><strong>Heatmap Visualization:</strong> Maps the spatial distribution of slowness anomalies, aiding geological interpretation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This method is widely used in geophysical exploration and research for imaging the Earth's subsurface.
